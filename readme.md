# Java Tax Calculator

This is a console application written in Java 8 that calculates the net tax payable for an individual based on their
taxable income, investment, and other factors such as their payer category and payer zone. The code uses various classes
and methods to perform the necessary calculations and print out the details of each step.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Java 8 or later installed on your computer.

Once you have Java installed, you can compile and run the `Main.java` file using a Java compiler or an IDE such as
Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

## Usage

To use this application, you need to provide the necessary input data such as the individual's basic salary, house rent,
medical allowance, conveyance allowance, incentive, festival bonus, payer category, and payer zone. These values are
initialized in the `Main.java` file, and you can modify them as needed.

(Note: The values are initialized in
the `main()` method. This is a temporary solution, and in the future, the input data will be provided by the user.)

Once you have set the input data, you can run the application to calculate the net tax payable for the individual. The
application will print out the details of each step of the calculation, including the taxable income, gross tax
liability, rebate, and net tax payable.

## Future Improvements

In the future, this application could be integrated with a web framework such as Spring to provide a more user-friendly
interface for entering input data and displaying the results.

## Inspiration

The business logic for this application was inspired by the tax calculator provided by the Rongdhonustudio
website: https://rongdhonustudio.com/TaxCalculator.html . The Business Logic behind the Tax Calculator is re-written by
me in
JAVA 8 from the original source code.
